# UnityCubetastic
A 3D  touch enabled game for android, where we have to control a cube and avoid obstacles. The game has 3 stages and includes the basic Unity UI.

Avoid dashing your block into the obstacle blocks and complete the run for 3 Levels.

Destruction mode:
Tick on the destructive mode before starting the game. In this mode, the position of obstacle blocks does not reset after each retry, thus making it easier to pass the levels.

Controls:
Touch anywhere on the left side of screen to steer left and touch the right side to steer right.
